```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
councildf<-group_by(post_2013_permits, CouncilDst) %>%
summarise(tot_new = sum(ClassANet))
qplot(x = CouncilDst, y = tot_new, data = councildf, geom = "col")
```

```{r}
councilmemberdf<-group_by(permits_by_councilor, council.member, CouncilDst) %>%
summarise(tot_new = sum(ClassANet))
```

Renata merge if I have to map
```{r}
left_join(post_2013_permits_dropped_splits_years_fixed, post_2013_councilmembers, by = c("CouncilDst" = "district")) %>% 
    filter(pmap_lgl(list(PermitYear, start.date, end.date), ~ ..1 %within% interval(..2, ..3)))
```
