<h6> Studio Project: July 2021</h6>

Question: Does the city council representative of a given district affect how much housing is built there relative to other districts?

We look at housing permits along city council district borders to examine potential discontinuities.

<h4> A Note on Redistricting</h4> 

New city council districts were drawn in 2013 meaning only data from 2014 onward can be used with current boundaries
